# Task Breakdown Generator

## Purpose
Generate hierarchical task breakdowns with detailed implementation sub-steps, ensuring all coding tasks are properly structured and dependencies are managed.

## Usage
**Input Required:**
- Task description in JSON format
- Technical stack details
- Any existing task breakdown for comparison

## Prompt Template

```
You are an AI coding assistant responsible for actually writing the code to complete tasks.

You are given a task in JSON format. Your job is to:

**Step 1: Validation**
Check if the input JSON is missing any important details needed for coding.

**Step 2: Gap Resolution**
If there are gaps:
- Ask me direct clarifying questions
- Once I answer, automatically update the input JSON by inserting new fields or sections with my answers
- Show me the updated JSON so I can confirm it looks correct
- Only proceed to step breakdown once the JSON is fully updated and confirmed

**Step 3: High-Level Breakdown**
Break the task into high-level steps with sub-steps to be expanded during implementation:
- Create major logical phases (e.g., SETUP, DATA_LAYER, UI_COMPONENTS)
- Each high-level step should contain `sub_steps_to_expand` that list specific coding tasks
- Sub-steps should be small enough to implement in 10-30 lines of code each
- DO NOT create separate review steps - reviews should be integrated within the detailed sub-steps

**Step 4: Logical Grouping**
Group steps by logical phases rather than strict page/component boundaries:
- Consider dependencies and shared functionality when ordering steps
- Plan the most efficient implementation sequence

**Step 5: Technical Architecture**
Include technical details section with framework, styling, state management, and other architectural decisions.

**Step 6: Step Assignment**
Assign each high-level step:
- A unique `step_id`
- A description of the overall phase
- Dependencies (which step(s) must be done before this one)
- Status (`pending|in_progress|completed`)
- Estimated time in minutes
- A `sub_steps_to_expand` array with specific coding tasks to be broken down later

**Step 7: Version Management**
If a previous version of steps is provided, compare against it:
- Keep completed steps marked as `completed`
- Only add new or modified steps as `pending`

**Step 8: Clarification Protocol**
At any point, if you realize there are ambiguities, ask clarifying questions before continuing.

**Output Format:**
Return a JSON structure following this exact schema:

```json
{
  "task_id": "string",
  "version": "int",
  "breakdown_type": "hierarchical",
  "description": "string",
  "technical_details": {
    "framework": "string",
    "styling": "string",
    "state_management": "string",
    "data_source": "object",
    "deployment": "string",
    "build_tools": "string"
  },
  "steps": [
    {
      "step_id": "string",
      "description": "string",
      "status": "pending|in_progress|completed",
      "dependencies": ["step_id", ...],
      "estimated_time_min": "int",
      "sub_steps_to_expand": [
        "specific coding task 1",
        "specific coding task 2",
        "..."
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Requirements:**
1. Each sub-step should be actionable and specific
2. Sub-steps should represent discrete coding tasks
3. Maintain logical dependencies between phases
4. Consider error handling and validation requirements
5. Include setup, configuration, and testing tasks
6. Plan for iterative development and testing cycles
7. DO NOT create separate review steps (like "REVIEW_01", "REVIEW_02") - validation should be built into each step's completion criteria

**Input JSON:**
{TASK_JSON}
```

## Example Usage

For a React dashboard application task:

```
You are an AI coding assistant responsible for actually writing the code to complete tasks.

**Input JSON:**
{
  "task_id": "dashboard-app",
  "description": "Create a React dashboard with user authentication and data visualization",
  "technical_requirements": {
    "framework": "React + TypeScript",
    "styling": "Tailwind CSS",
    "authentication": "required",
    "data_visualization": "charts and graphs"
  }
}

[Assistant would process this and generate the hierarchical breakdown...]
```

## Customization Notes

1. **Technical Stack**: Modify the technical_details schema based on your project needs
2. **Step Granularity**: Adjust sub-step complexity based on your coding preferences
3. **Status Tracking**: Add additional status values if needed (e.g., "blocked", "testing")
4. **Dependencies**: Customize dependency tracking for complex project structures

## Integration

This prompt can be used with:
- Claude Code for immediate task breakdown and implementation
- Project management tools for task creation and tracking
- CI/CD pipelines for automated task validation
- Documentation generation for project planning

Save this prompt and customize the TASK_JSON placeholder for each project breakdown.
