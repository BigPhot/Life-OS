### Project State
```
Branch: main
Status: 3 changed files
Last commit: b4c135c feat(narrator-console): Complete SETUP_001-004 - Electron + React + Vite foundation
```

### Setup Progress
- Completed: 4/21 setup steps

### Session Notes
- Set up automatic session logging with script and hooks
- Moved .claude directory into .ai for better organization
- Created session-init.sh script that runs on SessionStart
- Added session logging reminder to prevent forgetting to update logs
- Fixed session script to avoid duplicate entries when testing
- Restructured session logging to use individual files in logs directory

### Commands Run
- `mv .claude .ai/` - Moved Claude config into .ai directory
- Updated session-init.sh script paths
- Tested session logging functionality
- Added reminder message to session-init.sh
- Created .ai/claude/logs directory structure
- Updated session-init.sh to create individual session files
- Fixed Windows port conflict: changed Vite dev server from port 3000 to 3001

### Decisions Made
- Organize all AI-related files under .ai/ directory
- Use SessionStart hook instead of manual session logging
- Keep session logs in .ai/claude/logs/ with individual files per session
- Use visible reminders at session start to ensure session log maintenance
- Create session index for easy navigation between sessions

### Important Context
- User develops on Windows but manages project via WSL/git sync
- Review-push workflow designed to sync changes between Windows and WSL environments
- Windows testing commands provided in review-push.md for this workflow
